<h1>
    Hello, Welcome to my website!
</h1>
<p>
My name is Enzo Conti, Iâ€™m a junior at Syracuse University studying Information Management and 
Technology with a concentration in Project Management. I am very interested in projects and 
understanding how they are carried out and hope to someday be a project manager myself. I love 
problem solving and can offer a vast amount of professional skills.

    charge of managing our website and posting our writers works
